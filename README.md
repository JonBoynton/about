# About Me

I’m a Software Developer/Entrepreneur with over 35 years of programming experience. Although my preferred programming language is Java, over the years I have worked with BASIC, FORTRAN, Pearl, C#, Javascript (of course), ES6, Python, PHP, JSP, ASP and many others to a lesser extent.

My primary focus, at the moment, is developing Distributed Database Technology for IoT. Early database experiences go back to the 80’s when I was introduced to applications like dBase and Q&A. Over the past 20 years or so, I’ve typically used MySQL and PostgreSQL for developing web applications. However, in the late 2000’s, I began looking at various emerging NoSQL technologies such as [Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/) and [HBase](https://hbase.apache.org/). These applications, and variations like Couchbase, DynamoDB, and MongoDB, are some of my “goto” solutions for distributed data.

My formal education was in Business; not Computing. However, early in my career, I discovered that writing software for my company was far more enjoyable than marketing and manufacturing. So, in the mid 90’s I began transitioning toward a career in Software Engineering… I have been writing code, and Loving the challenge of solving problems with software, ever since.
